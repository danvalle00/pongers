# Pongers

I took a evening to try to relearn things from Unity after the 6.x update that
changes somethings, now InputAction system is the standard and rb.velocity is deprecated. Crazy...

It felt good to take a break and code a small mini-game. though it's still pretty incomplete.
- No restart button (lol...)
- No Main Menu
- Sometimes the ball get stuck between the "AI", or between the player, and a wall, and stops moving.

I added sound fx for the first time in my mini-games. I got them from: [Bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net), I created the sounds by pressing the Pickup and Hit buttons and randomizing the sliders xdd. I locked the bit-noise setting for a 8bit flavor

~~what made me sad was when i imported the textmesh my language % is only shaderlab now :(~~
